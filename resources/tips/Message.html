    The Key Promoter X "should have been" a <em>dynamic plugin</em> now, which means it doesn't require a restart when
    you get an
    update. However, just after the update I realized there are issues with it. Hang in there, we'll get there
    eventually.

    Last week, people from
    <a href="https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner">
        CodeStream</a>
    reached out and proposed to sponsor the Key Promoter X.
    They provide an excellent tool for making collaborative project-work a breeze directly from within your IntelliJ
    IDE.
