<h2>Key Promoter X for 2020.1 EAP Products</h2>
<p>
    Since its first release, the Key Promoter X has now more than 650.000 downloads. It is top-rated on the JetBrains
    site,
    and since it is entirely open-source, other plugin developers can browse through the code to understand how things
    are implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The plugin is not for me or a by-product of something I would do anyway. It is for <em>you</em> who want to learn
    shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, and I give away some of my free time to keep it up to date and fix bugs. If you
    appreciate my efforts, then please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/halirutan">consider sponsoring me on
    GitHub</a>.
    And don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X">star the GitHub repository</a>
    and
    leave a rating on the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x">JetBrains plugin site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, don't be too shy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/halirutan/">connect on LinkedIn</a>. I'd like to
    know in which parts of the world the Key Promoter X is used.
