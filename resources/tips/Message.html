<h2>Key Promoter X for 2020.1.3</h2>
<p>
    The Key Promoter X is now a <strong>dynamic plugin</strong> which means it doesn't require a restart when you get an
    update. So this will hopefully be the last time you need to restart for an update of the Key Promoter X.
</p>
<p>
    Last week, the people from
    <a href="https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner">
        CodeStream</a>
    reached out and proposed to sponsor the Key Promoter X.
    They provide an excellent tool for making collaborative project-work a breeze directly from within your IntelliJ
    IDE.
    <a href="https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner">
        Go and check it out!</a>
